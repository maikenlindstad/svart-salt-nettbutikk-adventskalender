# Svart Salt Advent Calendar

In this repository, I am making an advent calender for my live e-commerce.

The idea is that the app will be fun to make, fun to use, and it will spread creepy holiday joy around
Norway.

Creepy? Yes!

My store is all about Witches and Halloween. While it is nice to have cosy cups of cocoa and jolly christmas
movies on the TV, it can also be fun to read about Krampus, fantasy monsters and terrible misfortunes.

It's all good fun, of course.

## Workflow

How I will go forward with the project.

### Scope

I want to make sure that the app is done by December 1th, which means that I have 10 days to make it. But I also want to spend some time marketing the calendar, so I will spend 3 days in the marketing section. This gives me 7 days to make the app.

### Design

A style tile to set the tone is always nice. Check out both style tile and prototype in the images/design folder. This would never stay in the app. This is just for repository purposes, so that you can have a look at it from here. The design was made earlier this year.

### Developing

I will start to make the app by adding an API. Since the app is small and short lived, I will make the API inside the app itself. Even though I won't add all my content yet, I will make sure the API provides enough
text to help in developing the app.
